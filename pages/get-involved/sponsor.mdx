# Sponsoring

Sponsorships help us maintain and expand the compute cluster. WATcloud started out on a shoestring budget. Over the years, we learned to be extremely efficient with our resources. We maximize the utility per dollar by designing our architecture around low-cost commodity hardware, aggressively seeking out opportune purchase windows (e.g. sales, promotions, bulk discounts, auctions), and using robust software for infrastructure provisioning and monitoring. For example, in 2023, we built a workstation machine with 6 GPUs (144 GiB VRAM in total), 512 GiB RAM, and 128 logical cores for less than CAD \$23,000[^trpro-cost]. An equivalent machine from a system integrator would cost at least CAD \$12,000 more[^system-integrator-quote].

[^trpro-cost]: The cost of the machine is calculated based on the price of the components at the time of purchase. A rough breakdown is as follows:
    - 2x RTX 4090 GPU: around CAD \$4,800
    - 4x RTX 3090 GPU: around CAD \$6,000
    - Threadripper 3995WX CPU (tray): CAD \$4,650
    - 512 GiB RAM: CAD \$4,215
    - Motherboard, PSU, SSDs, etc.: around CAD \$3,000
    - Total: around CAD \$22,665

[^system-integrator-quote]: Based on quotes we received from popular system integrators, many of whom gave us an academic discount.

## Your impact

WATcloud is used by students and researchers at the University of Waterloo and partnering student organizations. Our users come from a wide range of backgrounds, including computer science, engineering, and mathematics. They use WATcloud to run simulations, train machine learning models, and perform data analysis for projects like autonomous driving, robotics, and computational biology. WATcloud is maintained by a team of volunteers, who also gain valuable experience in system administration, DevOps, automation, and cloud infrastructure. As of January 2024, over 450 students and researchers have benefited from WATcloud, producing numerous research papers and projects. By sponsoring WATcloud, you will be supporting the next generation of researchers and engineers.

## What you get

If you are a company, we will feature your name on our website and in our promotional materials. We will also mention your sponsorship in our social media posts. If your contribution is significant, we will also refer students from both WATcloud and our parent organization, [WATonomous](https://watonomous.ca), to your company for co-op and full-time positions. If you are an individual, we will discuss with you on how you would like to be recognized.
