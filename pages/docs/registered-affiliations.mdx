# Registered Affiliations

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

WATcloud Registered Affiliations are groups whose members can request for WATcloud access. If you are
a group lead, please register your group using the [form](#registering-a-group) below.

<Callout type="info">
Registered affiliations is currently in public beta. Soon, all affiliations[^all-affiliations] will be
required to beome a registered affiliation.
</Callout>

[^all-affiliations]: Currently, there are many legacy affiliations who still go through the old process
as described in [History](#history).


## History

When WATcloud first opened up access to non-WATonomous groups, we asked group leads to provide
and maintain a list of their members who require access to WATcloud services. We then assigned a WATcloud
member to each group to act as a liaison and approve access requests from that group. This approach worked
reasonably well for a while, but as the number of groups grew, it became increasingly difficult to
keep track of who was in which group, and who was responsible for approving access requests. Moreover, we
also received requests from groups to get more visibility into the provisioning process, so that they could
resolve issues (e.g. incorrect GitHub usernames) themselves.

To address these issues, we created a new system for managing access to WATcloud services. We call this
system "Registered Affiliations". The idea is that we provide access to and train a few members from
each group to manage access to WATcloud services for their group. They become point of contact for their members
and will have visibility into the provisioning process. This allows us to scale up the number of groups
with minimal overhead.

## Registering a group

Please use the form below to register your group. We will review your request and get back to you to schedule
a training session.
