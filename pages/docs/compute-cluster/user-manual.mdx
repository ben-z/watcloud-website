# WATcloud Compute Cluster User Manual

This document contains everything you need to know to start using the WATcloud Compute Cluster.

## Announcements

All compute-cluster-related announcements will be posted in the [announcements mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/watonomous.ca/g/watcloud-compute-cluster-announcements). You are automatically subscribed to this list when you get access to the compute cluster.

## Getting Access

Please refer to the [Getting Access](./getting-access) page for instructions on how to get access to the compute cluster.

## Cluster overview

The WATcloud Compute Cluster is a collection of servers that are available for use by students and faculty at the University of Waterloo and partnering institutions.

The cluster is managed by [SLURM](./slurm), a job scheduler that allocates resources to jobs on a cluster of [compute nodes](/machines#compute-nodes).
There are a set of [login nodes](/machines#login-nodes) that can be used to submit jobs to the cluster.

All nodes in the cluster are headless, meaning they do not run display servers and do not have a GUI.
To run graphical applications, we refer users to use containerized display servers, such as [Neko](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko), [Selkies-GStreamer](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies), or [x11docker](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker).

## Logging In

After [getting access](./getting-access), you can log in to the cluster using SSH.
Please refer to the [SSH](./ssh) page for instructions on how to log in to the cluster.

## Submitting Jobs

After logging in to the cluster, you can submit jobs to the cluster using SLURM.
Please refer to the [SLURM](./slurm) page for instructions on how to submit jobs to the cluster.

## Usage Guidelines

The [login nodes](/machines#login-nodes) are meant for submitting jobs to the cluster and should not be used for heavy workloads. Some [quotas](./quotas) are enforced on the login nodes to prevent abuse.

## Hardware

All login nodes and compute nodes in the cluster are virtual machines (VMs). We use [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) as our hypervisor.
Hardware specs for the VMs and the underlying bare-metal servers can be found [here](/machines).

## Networking

All machines in the cluster are connected to both the university network (using 10Gbps or 1Gbps Ethernet)
and a cluster network (using 40Gbps or 10Gbps Ethernet). The IP address range for the university network is
`129.97.0.0/16`[^uwaterloo-ip-range] and the IP address range for the cluster network is `10.0.50.0/24`.

[^uwaterloo-ip-range]: The IP range for the university network can be found [here](https://uwaterloo.ca/information-systems-technology/about/organizational-structure/technology-integrated-services-tis/network-services-resources/ip-requests-and-registrations).

## Storage

There are two types of storage available for users: networked storage and node-local storage.

### Networked Storage

All login nodes and compute nodes in the cluster have access to a set of networked storage locations:

**`/home` Directory**

We run an SSD-backed Ceph[^ceph] cluster to provide distributed storage for machines in the cluster.
All development machines share a common `/home` directory that is backed by the Ceph cluster.

Due to the relatively expensive cost of SSDs and observations that large file transfers can slow down the filesystem for all users,
the home directory should only be used for storing small files.
If you need to store large files (e.g. datasets, videos, ML model checkpoints), please use one of the other storage options below.

[^ceph]: [Ceph](https://ceph.io/) is a distributed storage system that provides high performance and reliability.

**`/mnt/wato-drive*` Directory**

We have a few HDD-backed NFS[^nfs] servers that provide large storage for machines in the cluster.
These NASes are mounted on all development machines at the `/mnt/wato-drive*` directories.
You can use these mounts to store large files such as datasets and ML model checkpoints.

[^nfs]: [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) stands for "Network File System" and is used to share files over a network.

### Node-local Storage

On compute nodes, there is a local storage pool meant for fast, temporary storage. They can be requested per-job using the [`tmpdisk` resource](./slurm#grestmpdisk).

## Containerization

There are various containerization options available for users. This allows users to run their workloads in a consistent environment and install dependencies without affecting the rest of the system.

### Docker

Unlike most HPC clusters, we provide [Docker Rootless](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) on compute nodes. Instructions on how to use it can be found [here](./slurm#using-docker).

### Podman

[Podman](https://podman.io/) is installed on all login nodes and compute nodes.

### Apptainer

[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) (formerly known as [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/)) is available via [CVMFS](./slurm#cvmfs).

## Software

We try to keep the machines lean and generally refrain from installing software that make sense for rootless installation or running in
containerized environments.

Examples of software that we install:
- Docker (rootless)
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- zsh
- various CLI tools (e.g. `vifm`, `iperf`, `moreutils`, `jq`, `ncdu`)

Examples of software that we do not install:
- conda (use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) instead)
- ROS (use [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/ros) instead)
- CUDA (use [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda) instead. Or use [CVMFS](./slurm#cvmfs) on the SLURM compute nodes.)

If there is a piece of software that you think should be installed on the machines, please [reach out](./support-resources).

## Quotas

To keep the cluster running smoothly, we have a set of quotas that limit the amount of resources that can be used by each user.
Please refer to the [Quotas](./quotas) page for more information.

## Maintenance and Outages

We try to keep machines in the cluster up and running at all times. However, we need to perform regular maintenance to keep machines
up-to-date and services running smoothly. All scheduled maintenance will be announced in
[announcements mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/watonomous.ca/g/watcloud-compute-cluster-announcements).
Emergency maintenance and maintenance that has little effect on user experience will be announced in the `#🌩-watcloud-use` channel on Discord.

Sometimes, machines in the cluster may go down unexpectedly due to hardware failures or power outages.
We have a comprehensive suite of healthchecks and internal monitoring tools[^watcloud-observability] to detect these failures and notify us.
However, due to the part-time nature of the student team, we may not be able to respond to these failures immediately.
If you notice that a machine is down, please ping the WATcloud team on Discord
(`@WATcloud` or `@WATcloud Leads`, in the `#🌩-watcloud-use` channel).

[^watcloud-observability]: Please refer to the [Observability](/docs/community-docs/watcloud/observability) page to learn more about the tools we use to monitor the cluster.

To see if a machine is having issues, please visit [status.watonomous.ca](https://status.watonomous.ca). The WATcloud team uses this page as
a dashboard to monitor the health of machines in the cluster.


## Troubleshooting

This section contains some common issues that users may encounter when using machines in the cluster and their solutions. If you encounter an issue that is not listed here, please [reach out](./support-resources).
