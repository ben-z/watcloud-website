# WATcloud Maintenance Manual

This manual outlines the maintenance procedures for various components of WATcloud.

## General procedure

1. **Plan the maintenance**: Prepare a plan for the maintenance, including the start time, end time, and the steps to be taken during the maintenance. Identify the components and services that will be affected. Try to minimize the impact on users by using strategies like rolling updates.
1. **Notify users**: If the maintenance will affect users, [notify them in advance](#maintenance-email-generator). Make sure to give users plenty of time to prepare for the maintenance. In general, one week's notice is recommended.
1. **Perform the maintenance**: Follow the steps outlined in the maintenance plan. If the maintenance runs over the scheduled end time, notify users of the delay.
1. **Verify the maintenance**: After the maintenance is complete, verify that all components are working as expected (including CI pipelines). If there are any issues, address them immediately. Use [observability tools](./observability) to monitor the health of the system.
1. **Notify users**: Once the maintenance is complete, update the maintenance announcement to indicate that the maintenance is complete. If there were any issues during the maintenance, provide details on what happened and how it was resolved.

## SLURM

This section outlines the maintenance procedures for the SLURM cluster.

### Cluster overview

To get a general overview of the health of the SLURM cluster, you can run:

```bash copy
sinfo --long
```

Example output:

```

```

In the output above, `tr-slurm1` is in the `drained` state, which means it is not available for running jobs.
`thor-slurm1` is in the `mix` state, which means some jobs are running on it.
All other nodes are in the `idle` state, which means there are no jobs running on them.

To get a detailed overview of nodes in the cluster, you can run:

```bash copy
scontrol show node [NODE_NAME]
```

The optional `NODE_NAME` argument can be used to restrict the output to a specific node.

Example output:

```text {11,20}

   Reason=Performing maintenance on baremetal [root@2024-04-18T17:06:20] 
```

In the output above, we can see that the reason `tr-slurm1` is in the `drained` state (a.k.a. `IDLE+DRAIN`) for reason `Performing maintenance on baremetal`.
The `Reason` field is an arbitrary user-specified string that can be set when performing actions on nodes.

### Performing maintenance on a node

#### Creating a reservation

The first step to performing maintenance on a node is to create a reservation[^slurm-reservation].
This ensures that user-submitted jobs do not get dispatched to the target nodes if they cannot be
completed before the maintenance window starts.

[^slurm-reservation]: The official documentation for reservations is at https://slurm.schedmd.com/reservations.html

```bash copy
scontrol create reservation starttime=<START_TIME> duration=<DURATION_IN_MINUTES> user=root flags=maint nodes=<NODE_NAMES>
```

The time zone for the `starttime` argument is the local time zone where the command is run.
To see the local timezone, run `timedatectl`.

Here's an example:

```bash copy
scontrol create reservation starttime=2024-04-30T21:00:00 duration=480 user=root flags=maint nodes=trpro-slurm1,trpro-slurm2
```

output:

```text
Reservation created: root_4
```

This command creates a reservation named `root_4`. The reservation starts on
April 30, 2024, at 9:00 PM local time and lasts for
8 hours (480 minutes) for the nodes `trpro-slurm1` and `trpro-slurm2`.
During this time, only the root user can run jobs on these nodes.
Jobs submitted by other users will be queued until the reservation is over.

To see existing reservations, you can run:

```bash copy
scontrol show reservation
```

To delete a resservation, you can run:

```bash copy
scontrol delete reservation <RESERVATION_NAME>
```


#### Starting maintenance

Before performing maintenance on a node, you should drain the node to ensure no jobs are running on it and no new jobs are scheduled to run on it.

```bash
scontrol update nodename="<NODE_NAME>" state=drain reason="Performing maintenance for reason X"
```

For example:

```bash copy
scontrol update nodename="tr-slurm1" state=drain reason="Performing maintenance on baremetal"
```

This will drain the node `tr-slurm1` (prevent new jobs from running on it) and set the reason to `Performing maintenance on baremetal`.
If there are no jobs running on the node, the node state becomes `drained` (a.k.a. `IDLE+DRAIN` in `scontrol`).
If there are jobs running on the node, the node state becomes `draining` (a.k.a. `MIXED+DRAIN` in `scontrol`).
In this case, SLURM will wait for the jobs to finish before transitioning the node to the `drained` state.

Example output from when a node is in the `draining` state:

```text {4,18,27}

After jobs finish running on the node, the node will transition to the `drained` state:

   Reason=Performing maintenance on baremetal [root@2024-04-18T17:16:01]
```

Once the node is in the `drained` state, you can perform maintenance on it.

#### Taking a node out of maintenance mode

To take a node out of maintenance mode, you can run:

```bash
scontrol update nodename="<NODE_NAME>" state=resume
```

For example:

```bash copy
scontrol update nodename="tr-slurm1" state=resume
```

This will resume the node `tr-slurm1` (allow new jobs to run on it) and clear the reason.

Also remember to delete any unexpired reservations (as outlined in [Creating a reservation](#creating-a-reservation)).

## Troubleshooting

### SLURM `Invalid user id` when creating a reservation

If you get `Error creating the reservation: Invalid user id` when creating a reservation, it may mean that you don't have sufficient permissions to create a reservation. You can try running the command with `sudo`. For example:

```
> sudo $(which scontrol) create reservation starttime=2025-04-27T19:00:00 duration=120 user=root flags=maint nodes=thor-slurm1
Reservation created: root_12
```

### SLURM `Requested nodes are busy` when creating a reservation

If you get `Error creating the reservation: Requested nodes are busy` when creating a reservation, it means that the nodes you are trying to reserve are already in use. E.g. there are jobs on the node with end time during the reservation window.

```
> scontrol create reservation starttime=2025-04-27T19:00:00 duration=120 user=root flags=maint nodes=thor-slurm1
Error creating the reservation: Requested nodes are busy
```

You can check which jobs are running on the node with:

```bash copy
squeue --nodelist=<NODE_NAME>
```

For example:

```bash
> squeue --nodelist=thor-slurm1
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
            156143   compute slurm-sl watcloud  R       0:03      1 thor-slurm1
            156144   compute slurm-sl watcloud  R       0:02      1 thor-slurm1
            156133   compute slurm-sl watcloud  R       0:23      1 thor-slurm1
```

You can view the end time of a job with:

```bash
scontrol show job <JOB_ID>
```

For example:

```bash {10}
> scontrol show job 156143

```

If the job is long-running and you think it will finish before the maintenance starts, you can force create the reservation with the `ignore_jobs` flag. For example:

```bash
> scontrol create reservation starttime=2025-04-27T19:00:00 duration=120 user=root flags=maint,ignore_jobs nodes=thor-slurm1
Reservation created: root_12
```

Before the maintenance starts, just make sure that the job is finished before proceeding.
